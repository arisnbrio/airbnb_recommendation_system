By using the category/genre of the user's previous stay, we predict where the user would most likely stay next. For example, if a user stayed in an apartment in Brooklyn, we would match the user to similar priced apartments in areas in or around Brooklyn.

Models used: Multiple Linear Regression, XGBoost, TfidfVectorizer, K-modes & Kmeans clustering.
